Code and examples for my master thesis.

Please keep in mind that while the majority of readers are only with pure math background and do not have computer science or software engineering backgrounds, I built this project with the assumption that a reader just has to know the very minimum of Python and programming. Almost every mathematical function was therefore rebuilt in this project, with the exception of three operations: math.exp(), math.log(), and statistics.mean(). Similarly, loops were not implemented in recursions, and when dealing with cases, only ``if'' and ``else'' statements are utilized. Readers who are knowledgeable with software engineering are encouraged to modify this code.
