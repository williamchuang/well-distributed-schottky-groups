Code and examples for my master thesis.

Please keep in mind that while the majority of readers are only with pure math background and do not have computer science or software engineering backgrounds, I built this project with the assumption that a reader just has to know the very minimum of Python and programming. Almost every mathematical function was therefore rebuilt in this project, with the exception of three operations: math.exp(), math.log(), and statistics.mean(). Similarly, loop    s were not implemented in recursions, and when dealing with cases, only ``if'' and ``else'' statements are utilized. Furthermore, this code is highly adaptable and may be used in parallel processing with multithreading methods, depending on the study environment of the users. To protect its full potential and to keep it concise and tidy, I've simply included a few working samples in this repository. Readers who are familiar with software engineering, particularly high speed computing, are urged to change this code to their liking.
