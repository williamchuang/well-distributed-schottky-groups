# well-distributed-schottky-groups
Code and examples for my master thesis.

Potential application:
1) It's well-known that elliptic curves which is based on SL(2,Z) can be used for encryption. Schottky is a more general setting which is based on PSL(2,R). In a variety of ways (either in the fashion of agebraic curves, or a direct application), this code could also work as a cipher device for non-linear encryption. 

TO DO:
1) Implement the current code in parallel computing.
2) Compute the results for deeper levels.
