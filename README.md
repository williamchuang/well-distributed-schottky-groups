Code and examples for my master thesis.

Please mind that considering the majority of readers are from pure math background and don't have computer science or software engineering background, when I wrote this project I only assume the minimum knowledge of Python and programming a reader needs to know. Thus, almost every mathematical functions were reconstructed in this project except three operations math.exp(), math.log(), and statistics.mean(). With the same consideration, loops did not be implemented in recursions, and when dealing with multiple cases, only if and else statements are used.
